This project deals with the analysis of EV charging hub data from Los Angeles. 

The 3 files 01_Data_Preparation, 02_Model_Analysis, and 03_Final_Submission reflect the 3 milestone submissions.
Accordingly the final state of our project can be found in 03_Final_Submission. We used Python 3.12.2 for the Notebook. With lower versions of Python some of the graphs are not displayed correctly.
